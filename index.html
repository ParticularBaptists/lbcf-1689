			<h2>Of the Holy Scriptures</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>
				The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Timothy 3:15, 16, 17; Isaiah 8:20; Luke 16:29, 31; Ephesians 2:20;">a</span> rule of all saving Knowledge, Faith and Obedience; Although the <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 1:14, 15; Psalms 19:1, 2, 3;">a</span> light of Nature, and the works of Creation and Providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom and power of God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and His will, which is necessary unto Salvation. <span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1;">b</span> Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that His will unto his Church; and afterward for the better preserving, and propagating of the Truth, and for the more sure Establishment, and Comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the World, to commit the same wholly unto <span class="ref" data-verses="Proverbs 22:19, 20, 21; Romans 15:4; 2 Peter 1:19, 20;">c</span> writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of Gods revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				Under the Name of Holy Scripture or the Word of God written; are now contained all the Books of the Old and New Testament which are these,
				<br/>
				Of the Old Testament.
				<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Genesis</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				Of the New Testament.
				<br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Matthew</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				The Books commonly called Apocrypha not being of <span class="ref" data-verses="Luke 24:44; Romans 3:2;">d</span> Divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon (or rule) of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority to the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of, then other humane writings.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>
				The Authority of the Holy Scripture for which it ought to be believed dependeth not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 1:19, 20, 21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9;">e</span> God (who is truth it self) the Author thereof; therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
				We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church of God, to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, and the Majesty of the stile, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God) the full discovery it makes of the only way of mans salvation, and many other incomparable Excellencies, and intire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding; our <span class="ref" data-verses="John 2:27; 1 Corinthians 2:1;">f</span> full perswasion, and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our Hearts.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
				The whole Councel of God concerning all things <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Timothy 3:15, 16, 17; Galatians 1:8, 9;">g</span> necessary for his own Glory, Mans Salvation, Faith and Life, is either expressely set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelation of the Spirit, or traditions of men.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>
				All things in Scripture are not alike <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 3:16;">h</span> plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all; yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for Salvation, are so <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 19:130;">i</span> clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient understanding of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>
				The Old Testament in <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 3:2;">j</span> Hebrew, (which was the Native language of the people of God of old) and the New Testament in Greek (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the Nations being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and Providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore <span class="ref" data-verses="Isaiah 8:20;">k</span> authentical; so as in all controversies of Religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them <span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 15:15;">l</span> But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read <span class="ref" data-verses="John 5:39;">m</span> and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar language of every Nation, unto which they <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 14,:28;">n</span> come, that the Word of God dwelling <span class="ref" data-verses="Colossians 3:16;">o</span> plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>
				The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 1:20, 21; Acts 15:15, 16;">p</span> Scripture it self: And therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold but one) it must be searched by other places that speak more clearly.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">10.</span>
				The supream judge by which all controversies of Religion are to be determined, and all Decrees of Councels, opinions of antient Writers, Doctrines of men, and private Spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 22:31; Ephesians 2:20; Acts 28:23;">q</span> Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally resolved.

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				God having all <span class="ref" data-verses="John 5:26;">h</span> life, <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 148:13;">i</span> glory, <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 119:68;">j</span> goodness, blessedness, in and of himself: is alone in, and unto himself all-sufficient, not <span class="ref" data-verses="Job 22:2, 3;">k</span> standing in need of any Creature which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but onely manifesting his own glory in, by, unto, and upon them, he is the alone fountain of all Being, <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 11:34, 35, 36;">l</span> of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things, and he hath most soveraign <span class="ref" data-verses="Daniel 4:25, 34, 35;">m</span> dominion over all creatures, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth; in his sight <span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 4:13;">n</span> all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is <span class="ref" data-verses="Ezekiel 11:5; Acts 15:18;">o</span> infinite, infallible, and independant upon the Creature, so as nothing is to him contingent, or uncertain; he is most holy in all his Councels, in <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 145:17;">p</span> all his Works, and in all his Commands; to him is due <span class="ref" data-verses="Revelation 5:12, 13, 14;">q</span> from Angels and men, whatsoever worship, service, or obedience as Creatures they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.

				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, <span class="ref" data-verses="1 John 5:7; Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14;">r</span> the Father the Word (or Son) and Holy Spirit, of one substance, power, and Eternity, each having the whole Divine Essence, <span class="ref" data-verses="Exodus 3:14; John 14:11; 1 Corinthians 8:6;">s</span> yet the Essence undivided, the Father is of none neither begotten nor proceeding, the Son is <span class="ref" data-verses="John 1:14, 18;">t</span> Eternally begotten of the Father, the holy Spirit <span class="ref" data-verses="John 15:26; Galatians 4:6;">u</span> proceeding from the Father and the Son, all infinite, without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in nature and Being; but distinguished by several peculiar, relative properties, and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our Communion with God, and comfortable dependance on him.

			<h2>Of Gods Decree</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>
				God hath <span class="ref" data-verses="Isaiah 46:10; Ephesians 1:11; Hebrews 6:17; Romans 9:15, 18;">v</span> Decreed in himself from all Eternity, by the most wise and holy Councel of his own will, freely and unchangeably, all things whatsoever comes to passe; yet so as thereby is God neither the author of sin, <span class="ref" data-verses="James 1:15, 17; 1 John 1:5;">w</span> nor hath fellowship with any therein, nor is violence offered to the will of the Creature, nor yet is the liberty, or contingency of second causes taken away, but rather <span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 4:27, 28; John 19:11;">x</span> established, in which appears his wisdom in disposing all things, and power, and faithfulness <span class="ref" data-verses="Numbers 23:19; Ephesians 1:3, 4, 5;">y</span> in accomplishing his Decree.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				Although God knoweth whatsoever may, or can come to passe upon all <span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 15:18;">z</span> supposed conditions; yet hath he not Decreed anything, <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 9:11, 13, 16, 18;">a</span> because he foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass upon such conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				By the decree of God for the manifestation of his glory <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Timothy 5:21; Matthew 25:41;">b</span> some men and Angels, are predestinated, or fore-ordained to Eternal Life, through Jesus Christ to the <span class="ref" data-verses="Ephesians 1:5, 6;">c</span> praise of his glorious grace; others being left to act in their sin to their <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 9:22, 23; Jude 4;">d</span> just condemnation, to the praise of his glorious justice.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>
				These Angels and Men thus predestinated, and fore-ordained, are particularly, and unchangeably designed; and their <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Timothy 2:19; John 13:18;">e</span> number so certain, and definite, that it cannot be either increased, or diminished.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
				Those of mankind <span class="ref" data-verses="Ephesians 1:4, 9, 11; Romans 8:30; 2 Timothy 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:9;">f</span> that are predestinated to life, God before the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret Councel and good pleasure of his will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of his meer free grace and love; <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 9:13, 16; Ephesians 1:3, 12;">g</span> without any other thing in the creature as a condition or cause moving him thereunto.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
				As God hath appointed the Elect unto glory, so he hath by the eternal and most free purpose of his will, fore-ordained <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Peter 1:2; 2 Thessalonians 2:13;">h</span> all the means thereunto, wherefore they who are elected, being faln in Adam, <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Thessalonians 5:9, 10;">i</span> are redeemed by Christ, are effectually <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 8:30; 2 Thessalonians 2:13;">j</span> called unto faith in Christ, by his spirit working in due season, are justifyed, adopted, sanctified, and kept by his power through faith <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Peter 1:5;">k</span> unto salvation; neither are any other redeemed by Christ, or effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the Elect <span class="ref" data-verses="John 6:64; John 10:26; John 17:9">l</span> only.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>
				The Doctrine of this high mystery of predestination, is to be handled with special prudence, and care; that men attending the will of God revealed in his word, and yeilding obedience thereunto, may from the certainty of their effectual vocation, be assured of their <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Thessalonians 1:4, 5; 2 Peter 1:10;">m</span> eternal election; so shall this doctrine afford matter <span class="ref" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6; Romans 11:33;">n</span> of praise, reverence, and admiration of God, and <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 11:5, 6;">o</span> of humility, diligence, and abundant <span class="ref" data-verses="Luke 10:20;">p</span> consolation, to all that sincerely obey the Gospel.

			<h2>Of Creation</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>
				In the beginning it pleased God the Father, <span class="ref" data-verses="John 1:2, 3; Hebrews 1:2; Job 26:13;">j</span> Son, and Holy Spirit, for the manifestation of the glory of <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 1:20;">k</span> his eternal power, wisdom, and goodness, to Create or make the world, and all things therein, <span class="ref" data-verses="Colossians 1:16; Genesis 2:1, 2;">l</span> whether visible or invisible, in the space of six days, and all very good.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				After God had made all other Creatures, he Created <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 1:27;">m</span> man, male and female, with <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 2:7;">n</span> reasonable and immortal souls, rendring them fit unto that life to God; for which they were Created; being <span class="ref" data-verses="Ecclesiastes 7:29; Genesis 1:26;">o</span> made after the image of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holyness; having the Law of God <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 2:14, 15;">p</span> written in their hearts, and power to fulfill it; and yet under a possibility of transgressing, being left to the liberty of their own will, which was <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 3:6;">q</span> subject to change.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				Besides the Law written in their hearts, they received <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 6:8, 9, 10;">r</span> a command not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; which whilst they kept, they were happy in their Communion with God, and had dominion <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 1:26, 28;">s</span> over the Creatures.

			<h2>Of Divine Providence</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>
				God the good Creator of all things, in his infinite power, and wisdom, doth <span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3; Job 38:11; Isaiah 46:10, 11; Psalms 135:6;">t</span> uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all Creatures, and things, from the greatest even to the <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 10:29, 30, 31;">u</span> least, by his most wise and holy providence, to the end for the which they were Created; according unto his infallible foreknowledge, and the free and immutable Councel of his <span class="ref" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11;">v</span> own will; to the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power, justice, infinite goodness and mercy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				Although in relation to the foreknowledge and Decree of God, the first cause, all things come to pass <span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 2:23;">w</span> immutably and infallibly; so that there is not any thing, befalls any <span class="ref" data-verses="Proverbs 16:33;">x</span> by chance, or without his Providence; yet by the same Providence he ordereth them to fall out, according to the nature of second causes, either <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 8:22;">y</span> necessarily, freely, or contingently.

			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				God in his ordinary Providence <span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 27:44; Isaiah 55:11;">z</span> maketh use of means; yet is free <span class="ref" data-verses="Hosea 1:7;">a</span> to work, without, <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 4:19, 20, 21;">b</span> above, and <span class="ref" data-verses="Daniel 3:27;">c</span> against them at his pleasure.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>
				The Almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of God, so far manifest themselves in his Providence, that his determinate Councel <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 11:34; 2 Samuel 24:1; 1 Chronicles 21:1;">d</span> extendeth it self even to the first fall, and all other sinful actions both of Angels, and Men; (and that not by a bare permission) which also he most wisely and powerfully <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Kings 19:28; Psalms 76:10;">e</span> boundeth, and otherwise ordereth, and governeth, in a manifold dispensation to his most holy <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 50:20; Isaiah 10:12;">f</span> ends: yet so, as the sinfulness of their acts proceedeth only from the Creatures, and not from God; who being most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be, the author or <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 50:1; John 2:16;">g</span> approver of sin.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
				The most wise, righteous, and gracious God, doth oftentimes, leave for a season his own children to manifold temptations, and the corruptions of their own heart, to chastise them for their former sins, or to discover unto them the hidden strength of corruption, and deceitfulness of their hearts, <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Chronicles 32:31; 2 Samuel 24:1; 2 Corinthians 12:7, 8, 9;">h</span> that they may be humbled; and to raise them to a more close, and constant dependence for their support, upon himself; and to make them more watchful against all future occasions of sin, and for other just and holy ends.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
				As for those wicked and ungodly men, whom God as a righteous judge, for former sin doth <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 1:7, 8;">i</span> blind and harden; from them he not only withholdeth his <span class="ref" data-verses="Deuteronomy 29:4;">j</span> Grace, whereby they might have been inlightned in their understanding, and wrought upon in their hearts: But sometimes also withdraweth <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 13:12;">k</span> the gifts which they had, and exposeth them to such <span class="ref" data-verses="Deuteronomy 2:30; 2 Kings 8:12, 13;">l</span> objects as their corruptions makes occasion of sin; and withall <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 81:11, 12; 2 Thessalonians 2:10, 11, 12;">m</span> gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan, whereby it comes to pass, that they <span class="ref" data-verses="Exodus 8:32; Isaiah 6:9, 10; 1 Peter 2:7, 8;">n</span> harden themselves, even under those means which God useth for the softning of others.

			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>
				As the Providence of God doth in general reach to all Creatures, so after a most special manner it taketh care of his <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Timothy 4:10; Amos 9:9; Isaiah 43:3, 4, 5;">o</span> Church, and disposeth of all things to the good thereof.

				<span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
				The Lord Jesus by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself, which he through the Eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, (f) hath fully satisfied the Justice of God, procured reconciliation, and purchased an Everlasting inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven, (g) for all those whom the Father hath given unto him.

				This number and order of Offices is necessary; for in respect of our (r) ignorance, we stand in need of his prophetical Office; and in respect of our alienation from God, (s) and imperfection of the best of our services, we need his Priestly office, to reconcile us, and present us acceptable unto God: and in respect o our averseness, and utter inability to return to God, and for our rescue, and security from our spiritual adversaries, we need his Kingly office, (t) to convince, subdue, draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to his Heavenly Kingdome.

			<h2>Of Good Works</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>
				Good Works are only such as God hath <span class="ref" data-verses="Micah 6:8; Hebrews 13:21;">v</span> commanded in his Holy word; and not such as without the warrant thereof, are devised by men, out of blind zeal, <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 15:9; Isaiah 29:13;">w</span> or upon any pretence of good intentions.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				These good works, done in obedience to Gods commandments, are the fruits, and evidences <span class="ref" data-verses="James 2:22;">x</span> of a true, and lively faith; and by them Believers manifest their <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 116:12, 13;">y</span> thankfullness, strengthen their <span class="ref" data-verses="1 John 2:5; 2 Peter 1:5-11;">z</span> assurance, edifie their <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 5:16;">a</span> brethren, adorn the profession of the Gospel, stop the mouths of the adversaries and glorifie <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Timothy 6:1; 1 Peter 2:15; Philippians 1:11;">b</span> God whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus <span class="ref" data-verses="Ephesians 2:10;">c</span> thereunto, that having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 6:22;">d</span> eternal life.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				Their ability to do good works, is not at all of themselves; but wholly from the Spirit <span class="ref" data-verses="John 15:6;">e</span> of Christ; and that they may be enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already received, there is necessary an <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Corinthians 3:5; Philippians 2:13;">f</span> actual influence of the same Holy Spirit, to work in them to will, and to do, of his good pleasure; yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unless upon a special motion of the Spirit; but they ought to be diligent in <span class="ref" data-verses="Philippians 2:12; Hebrews 6:12; Isaiah 64:7;">g</span> stirring up the Grace of God that is in them.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>
				They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height which is possible in this life, are so far from being able to superrogate, and to do more then God requires, as that <span class="ref" data-verses="Job 9:3; Galatians 5:17; Luke 17:10;">h</span> they fall short of much which in duty they are bound to do.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
				We cannot by our best works merit pardon of Sin or Eternal Life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them and the glory to come; and the infinite distance that is between us and God, whom by them we can neither profit, nor satisfie for the debt of our <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 4:6; Ephesians 2:8, 9;">i</span> former sins; but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants; and because as they are good they proceed from his <span class="ref" data-verses="Galatians 5:22, 23;">j</span> Spirit, and as they are wrought by us they are defiled <span class="ref" data-verses="Isaiah 64:6; Psalms 143:2;">k</span> and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection that they cannot endure the severity of Gods judgement.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
				Yet notwithstanding the persons of Believers being accepted through Christ their good works also are accepted in <span class="ref" data-verses="Ephesians 1:6; 1 Peter 2:5;">l</span> him; not as though they were in this life wholly unblameable and unreprovable in Gods sight; but that he looking upon them in his Son is pleased to accept and reward that which is <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 25:23; Hebrews 6:10;">m</span> sincere although accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>
				Works done by unregenerate men although for the matter of them they may be things which God commands, and of good use, both to themselves and <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Kings 10:30; 1 Kings 21:27, 29;">n</span> others; yet because they proceed not from a heart purified by <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 4:5; Hebrews 11:6;">o</span> faith, nor are done in a right manner according to the <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 13:1;">p</span> word, nor to a right end the <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 6:5;">q</span> glory of God; they are therefore sinful and cannot please God; nor make a man meet to receive grace from <span class="ref" data-verses="Amos 5:21, 22; Romans 9:16; Titus 3:5;">r</span> God; and yet their neglect of them is more sinful and <span class="ref" data-verses="Job 21:14, 15; Matthew 25:41, 42, 43;">s</span> displeasing to God.

				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				This perseverance of the Saints depends not upon their own free will; but upon the immutability of the decree of <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 8:16;">w</span> Election flowing from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father; upon the efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 5:9, 10; John 14:19;">x</span> and Union with him, the <span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 6:17, 18;">y</span> oath of God, the abiding of his Spirit &amp; the <span class="ref" data-verses="1 John 3:9;">z</span> seed of God within them, and the nature of the <span class="ref" data-verses="Jeremiah 32:40;">a</span> Covenant of Grace from all which ariseth also the certainty and infallibility thereof.

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				This certainty is not a bare conjectural, and probable perswasion, grounded upon <span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 6:19;">k</span> a fallible hope; but an infallible assurance of faith founded on the Blood and Righteousness of Christ <span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 6:17, 18;">l</span> revealed in the Gospel; and also upon the inward <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 1:11;">m</span> evidence of those graces of the Spirit unto which promises are made, and on the testimony of the <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 8:15, 16;">n</span> Spirit of adoption, witnessing with our Spirits that we are the children of God; and as a fruit thereof keeping the heart both <span class="ref" data-verses="1 John 3:1, 2, 3;">o</span> humble and holy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>

				<span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>
				God gave to Adam a Law of universal obedience, <span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 1:27; Ecclesiastes 7:29;">b</span> written in his Heart, and a particular precept of not eating the Fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; by which he bound him, and all his posterity to personal entire exact and perpetual <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 10:5;">c</span> obedience; promised life upon the fulfilling, and <span class="ref" data-verses="Galatians 3:12;">d</span> threatned death upon the breach of it; and indued him with power and ability to keep it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				The same Law that was first written in the heart of man, <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 2:14, 15;">e</span> continued to be a perfect rule of Righteousness after the fall; &amp; was delivered by God upon Mount Sinai, in <span class="ref" data-verses="Deuteronomy 10:4;">f</span> Ten Commandments and written in two Tables; the four first containing our duty towards God, and the other six our duty to man.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				Besides this Law commonly called moral, God was pleased to give to the people of Israel Ceremonial Laws, containing several typical ordinances, partly of worship, <span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 10:1; Colossians 2:17;">g</span> prefiguring Christ, his graces, actions, sufferings, and benefits; and partly holding forth divers instructions <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 5:7;">h</span> of moral duties, all which Ceremonial Laws being appointed only to the time of reformation, are by Jesus Christ the true Messiah and only Law-giver who was furnished with power from the Father, for that end, <span class="ref" data-verses="Colossians 2:14, 16, 17; Ephesians 2:16;">i</span> abrogated and taken away.
			</p>

				<span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>
				To them also he gave sundry judicial Laws, which expired together with the state of that people, not obliging any now by vertue of that institution; their general <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 9:8, 9, 10;">j</span> equity onely, being of moral use.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
				The moral Law doth for ever bind all, <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 13:8, 9, 10; James 2:10, 11, 12;">k</span> as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof, and that not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the <span class="ref" data-verses="James 2:10, 11;">l</span> authority of God the Creator; who gave it: Neither doth Christ in the Gospel any way dissolve, <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 5:17, 18, 19; Romans 3:31;">m</span> but much strengthen this obligation.

				Although true Believers be not under the Law, as a Covenant of Works, <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 8:4; Galatians 2:16;">n</span> to be thereby Justified or condemned; yet it is of great use to them as well as to others: in that, as a Rule of Life, informing them of the Will of God, and their Duty, it directs and binds them, to walk accordingly; <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 3:&amp;;">o</span> discovering also the sinfull pollutions of their Natures, Hearts and Lives; so as Examining themselves thereby, they may come to further Conviction of, Humiliation for, and Hatred against Sin; together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ and the perfection of his Obedience: It is likewise of use to the Regenerate to restrain their Corruptions, in that it forbids Sin; and the Threatnings of it serve to shew what even their Sins deserve; and what afflictions in this Life they may expect for them, although free'd from the Curse and unallayed Rigor thereof. The Promises of it likewise shew them Gods approbation of Obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof, though not as due to them by the Law as a Covenant of Works; so as mans doing Good and refraining from Evil, because the Law incourageth to the one and deterreth from the other, is no Evidence of his being <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 6:12, 13, 14; 1 Peter 3:-13;">p</span> under the Law and not under Grace.

				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>

				The Revelation of the Gospel unto Sinners, made in divers times, and by sundry parts; with the addition of Promises, and Precepts for the Obedience required therein, as to the Nations, and Persons, to whom it is granted, is meerly of the <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 147,20:; Acts 16:7;">x</span> Soveraign Will and good Pleasure of God; not being annexed by vertue of any Promise, to the due improvement of mens natural abilities, by vertue of Common light received, without it; which none ever did <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 1:18;">y</span> make, or can so do: And therefore in all Ages the preaching of the Gospel hath been granted unto persons and Nations, as to the extent, or streightning of it, in great variety, according to the Councell of the Will of God.

			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				God alone is <span class="ref" data-verses="James 4:12; Romans 14:4;">k</span> Lord of the Conscience, and hath left it free from the Doctrines and Commandments of men, <span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 4:29; 1 Corinthians 7:23; Matthew 15:9:;">l</span> which are in any thing contrary to his Word, or not contained in it. So that to Believe such Doctrines, or obey such Commands out of Conscience, <span class="ref" data-verses="Colossians 2:20, 22, 23;">m</span> is to betray true liberty of Conscience; and the requiring of an <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 3:24;">n</span> implicit Faith, and absolute and blind Obedience, is to destroy Liberty of Conscience, and Reason also.

				As it is of the Law of nature, that in general a proportion of time by Gods appointment, be set a part for the Worship of God; so by his Word in a positive-moral, and perpetual Commandement, binding all men, in all Ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven for a (e) Sabbath to be kept holy unto him, which from the beginning of the World to the Resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week; and from the resurrection of Christ, was changed into the first day of the week (f) which is called the Lords day; and is to be continued to the end of the World, as the Christian Sabbath; the observation of the last day of the week being abolished.

			<h2>Of Lawful Oaths and Vows</h2>

				A lawful Oath is a part of religious worship, <span class="ref" data-verses="Exodus 20:7; Deuteronomy 10:20; Jeremiah 4:2;">n</span> wherein the person swearing in Truth, Righteousness, and Judgement, solemnly calleth God to witness what he sweareth; <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Corinthians 6:22, 23;">o</span> and to judge him according to the Truth or falseness thereof.

				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				The Name of God only is that by which men ought to swear; and therein it is to be used, with all Holy Fear and reverence, therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious, and dreadful name; or to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful and to be <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 5:37; James 5:12;">p</span> abhorred; yet as in matter of weight and moment for confirmation of truth, <span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 6:16; 2 Corinthians 1:23;">q</span> and ending all strife, an Oath is warranted by the Word of God; so a lawful Oath being imposed, <span class="ref" data-verses="Nehemiah 13:25;">r</span> by lawful Authority, in such matters, ought to be taken.

				<span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
				A Vow which is not to be made to any Creature, but to God alone, <span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 76:11; Genesis 28:22;">u</span> is to be made and performed with all Religious care, and faithfulness: But Popish Monastical Vows, <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 7:9;">v</span> of perpetual single life, professed <span class="ref" data-verses="Ephesians 4:28;">w</span> poverty, and regular obedience, are so far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are superstitious, <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 19:11;">x</span> and sinful snares, in which no Christian may intangle himself.

				The bodies of the unjust shall by the power of Christ, be raised to dishonour; the bodies of the just by his spirit unto honour, <span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 24:15; John 5:28, 29; Philippians 3:21;">t</span> and be made conformable to his own glorious Body.

			<h2>Of the Last Judgement</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>
				God hath appointed a Day wherein he will judge the world in Righteousness, by <span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 17:31; John 5:27;">u</span> Jesus Christ; to whom all power and judgement is given of the Father; in which Day not only the <span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 6:3; Judges 6:;">v</span> Apostate Angels shall be judged; but likewise all persons that have lived upon the Earth, shall appear before the Tribunal of Christ; <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Corinthians 5:10; Ecclesiastes 12:14; Matthew 25::32; Romans 14:12;">w</span> to give an account of their Thoughts, Words, and Deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				The end of Gods appointing this Day, is for the manifestation of the glory of his Mercy, in the Eternal Salvation of the Elect; <span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 9:22, 23;">x</span> and of his Justice in the Eternal damnation of the Reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient; for then shall the Righteous go into Everlasting Life, and receive that fulness of Joy, and Glory, with everlasting reward, in the presence <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 25:34; 2 Timothy 4:8;">y</span> of the Lord: but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into Eternal torments, and <span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:48; 2 Thessalonians 1:7, 8, 9, 10;">z</span> punished with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				As Christ would have us to be certainly perswaded that there shall be a Day of judgement, both <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Corinthians 5:10, 11;">a</span> to deter all men from sin, and for the greater <span class="ref" data-verses="2 Thessalonians 1:5, 6, 7;">b</span> consolation of the godly, in their adversity; so will he have that day unknown to Men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour, the <span class="ref" data-verses="Mark 13:35, 36, 37; Luke 13:35, 36;">c</span> Lord will come; and may ever be prepared to say, <span class="ref" data-verses="Revelation 22:20;">d</span> Come Lord Jesus, Come quickly, Amen.
