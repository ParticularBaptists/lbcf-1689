			<h2>Of the Holy Scriptures</h2>

				<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Timothy 3:15, 16, 17; Isaiah 8:20; Luke 16:29, 31; Ephesians 2:20;"> The Holy Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 1:14, 15; Psalms 19:1, 2, 3;"> rule of all saving Knowledge, Faith and Obedience; Although the </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 1:1;"> light of Nature, and the works of Creation and Providence do so far manifest the goodness, wisdom and power of God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and His will, which is necessary unto Salvation. </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Proverbs 22:19, 20, 21; Romans 15:4; 2 Peter 1:19, 20;"> Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in divers manners, to reveal himself, and to declare that His will unto his Church; and afterward for the better preserving, and propagating of the Truth, and for the more sure Establishment, and Comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan, and of the World, to commit the same wholly unto </span> writing; which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of Gods revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.
			</p>

				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				Under the Name of Holy Scripture or the Word of God written; are now contained all the Books of the Old and New Testament which are these,

				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				<span class="ref" data-verses="Luke 24:44; Romans 3:2;"> The Books commonly called Apocrypha not being of </span> Divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon (or rule) of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority to the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of, then other humane writings.
			</p>

				<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 1:19, 20, 21; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 John 5:9;"> The Authority of the Holy Scripture for which it ought to be believed dependeth not upon the testimony of any man, or Church; but wholly upon </span> God (who is truth it self) the Author thereof; therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
				<span class="ref" data-verses="John 2:27; 1 Corinthians 2:1;"> We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the Church of God, to an high and reverent esteem of the Holy Scriptures; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, and the Majesty of the stile, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God) the full discovery it makes of the only way of mans salvation, and many other incomparable Excellencies, and intire perfections thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; yet notwithstanding; our </span> full perswasion, and assurance of the infallible truth, and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our Hearts.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
				<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Timothy 3:15, 16, 17; Galatians 1:8, 9;"> The whole Councel of God concerning all things </span> necessary for his own Glory, Mans Salvation, Faith and Life, is either expressely set down or necessarily contained in the Holy Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelation of the Spirit, or traditions of men.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>
				<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 3:16;"> All things in Scripture are not alike </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 19:130;"> plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all; yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed, and observed for Salvation, are so </span> clearly propounded, and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of ordinary means, may attain to a sufficient understanding of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>
				<span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 3:2;"> The Old Testament in </span> Hebrew, (which was the Native language of the people of God of old) and the New Testament in Greek<span class="ref" data-verses="Isaiah 8:20;"> (which at the time of the writing of it was most generally known to the Nations being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and Providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 15:15;"> authentical; so as in all controversies of Religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them </span><span class="ref" data-verses="John 5:39;"> But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have a right unto, and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read </span> and search them, therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar<span class="ref" data-verses="1 Corinthians 14,:28;"> language of every Nation, unto which they </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Colossians 3:16;"> come, that the Word of God dwelling </span> plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>
				<span class="ref" data-verses="2 Peter 1:20, 21; Acts 15:15, 16;"> The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the </span> Scripture it self: And therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold but one) it must be searched by other places that speak more clearly.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">10.</span>
				<span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 22:31; Ephesians 2:20; Acts 28:23;"> The supream judge by which all controversies of Religion are to be determined, and all Decrees of Councels, opinions of antient Writers, Doctrines of men, and private Spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit, into which </span> Scripture so delivered, our faith is finally resolved.

				In this divine and infinite Being there are three subsistences, (d) the Father the Word (or Son) and Holy Spirit, of one substance, power, and Eternity, each having the whole Divine Essence, (e) yet the Essence undivided, the Father is of none neither begotten nor proceeding, the Son is (f) Eternally begotten of the Father, the holy Spirit (g) proceeding from the Father and the Son, all infinite, without beginning, therefore but one God, who is not to be divided in nature and Being; but distinguished by several peculiar, relative properties, and personal relations; which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our Communion with God, and comfortable dependance on him.

			<h2>Of Divine Providence</h2>

				God the good Creator of all things, in his<span class="ref" data-verses="Hebrews 1:3; Job 38:11; Isaiah 46:10, 11; Psalms 135:6;"> infinite power, and wisdom, doth </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Matthew 10:29, 30, 31;"> uphold, direct, dispose, and govern all Creatures, and things, from the greatest even to the </span> least, by his most wise and holy providence, to the end for the which they were Created; according unto his infallible foreknowledge, and the free and immutable Councel of his<span class="ref" data-verses="Ephesians 1:11;"> </span> own will; to the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power, justice, infinite goodness and mercy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>
				Although in relation to the foreknowledge and Decree of God<span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 2:23;">, the first cause, all things come to pass </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Proverbs 16:33;"> immutably and infallibly; so that there is not any thing, befalls any </span> by chance, or without his Providence; yet by the same Providence<span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 8:22;"> he ordereth them to fall out, according to the nature of second causes, either </span> necessarily, freely, or contingently.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>
				God in his ordinary Providence<span class="ref" data-verses="Acts 27:44; Isaiah 55:11;"> </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Hosea 1:7;"> maketh use of means; yet is free </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 4:19, 20, 21;"> to work, without, </span><span class="ref" data-verses="Daniel 3:27;"> above, and </span> against them at his pleasure.

				The Almighty power, unsearchable wisdom, and infinite goodness of God, so far manifest themselves in his Providence, that his<span class="ref" data-verses="Romans 11:34; 2 Samuel 24:1; 1 Chronicles 21:1;"> determinate Councel </span><span class="ref" data-verses="2 Kings 19:28; Psalms 76:10;"> extendeth it self even to the first fall, and all other sinful actions both of Angels, and Men; (and that not by a bare permission) which also he most wisely and powerfully </span> boundeth, and otherwise ordereth, and governeth, in a manifold dispensation to his<span class="ref" data-verses="Genesis 50:20; Isaiah 10:12;"> most holy </span> ends: yet so, as the sinfulness of their acts proceedeth only from the Creatures, and not from God<span class="ref" data-verses="Psalms 50:1; John 2:16;">; who being most holy and righteous, neither is nor can be, the author or </span> approver of sin.

				The distance between God and the Creature is so great, that although reasonable Creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator<span class="ref" data-verses="Luke 17:10; Job 35:8;">, yet they could never have attained the reward of Life, but by some </span> voluntary condescension on Gods part, which he hath been pleased to express, by way of Covenant.
